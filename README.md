## TODO
Figure out HTTPS so geolocation works outside local host  
Modularize css to component level  
Clean up all the TODOs in code base  
Create Tests  
UI improvements for smaller phones and desktop experience  

## What this project isn't. 
I don't want to build something that lets you cheat. So that means.. 
* No bots
* No harvesters
* No map scanning

## Special Thanks
API that makes this all possible -> https://github.com/cyraxx/pogobuf  
Data used to polyfill pokedex data  -> https://github.com/Biuni/PokemonGOPokedex
