# pokemon-go-helper
Nodejs webbased pokemon go helper aplication. WIP but functional!

## TODO
Fix ios/safari login button issue  
Figure out HTTPS so geolocation works outside local host  
Modularize css to component level  
Clean up all the TODOs in code base  
Create Tests  
UI improvements for desktop experience
Not sure if this is possible but idealy the pokemon go api should be entirely client side. (pure javascript)  

## Features
#### Pokemon Stat Checker: Evaluate player's pokemon to help identify strong pokemon.

## What this project isn't. 
I don't want to build something that lets you cheat. So that means.. 
* No bots
* No harvesters
* No map scanning

## Special Thanks
API that makes this all possible -> https://github.com/cyraxx/pogobuf  
Data used to polyfill pokedex data  -> https://github.com/Biuni/PokemonGOPokedex
